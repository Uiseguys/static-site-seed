# static-site-seed
Seed project for a static site based on Gatsby.

- Using web-components from https://github.com/Uiseguys/stencil-bs-ui-lib
- Using i18next translation provided through https://github.com/Uiseguys/loopback3-i18next

It's a sister project of:
 https://github.com/Uiseguys/ng-bs-redux-boilerplate
as well being an integration test for the projects listed above.
Also a very nice boilerplate/seed project for static sites  
 
## Roadmap 
 
- [ ] create two pages, ‘dashboard’ and ‘about’
- [ ] use main navigation bar from our stencilJS library
- [ ] use our i18next service to show a welcome headline and a welcome text on the dashboard
- [ ] use the changelog generation implemented in our Angular seed and display it on the ‘about’ page using the markdown component from our stencilJS library
